# Lua Programming Basics

Welcome to the **Lua Programming Basics** repository! This repository contains a comprehensive Lua script that covers the fundamental concepts of Lua programming. It's an excellent resource for beginners who are learning Lua or for anyone who needs a quick reference guide.

## Overview

This repository includes a single Lua script (`lua_basics.lua`) that demonstrates various key aspects of Lua programming, including:

1. **Variables and Data Types**: Learn how to work with numbers, strings, booleans, and `nil` in Lua.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.

3. **Strings**: Explore basic string operations, including getting the length of a string, converting to uppercase or lowercase, and extracting substrings.

4. **Conditionals**: Use `if`, `elseif`, and `else` statements to control the flow of your Lua program based on different conditions.

5. **Loops**: Understand the different types of loops in Lua, including `for`, `while`, and `repeat-until`, and how to use them effectively.

6. **Functions**: Learn how to define and call functions in Lua to make your code modular and reusable.

7. **Tables**: Discover Lua's powerful table data structure, which can act as arrays, dictionaries (key-value pairs), or even multi-dimensional arrays like matrices.

## File Structure

- **`lua_basics.lua`**: This is the main script file that contains all the basic Lua codes with detailed comments explaining each section.

## Getting Started

To run the script:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anupam-2309/Lua-Project.git
